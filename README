Rails 3.1.3 App using Backbone.js and Devise.

The app is a re-hash of the todo backbone.js app by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet, but instead of using localstorage, it's using rails 3.1.3 to store, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. 

In addition, the app by Jérôme was also extended to make use of Devise in order to quickly setup to authentication. All resulting tasks created in a todo list are dependent of a given user.
